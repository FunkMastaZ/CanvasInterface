# CanvasInterface
A user interface for many admin features within the Canvas LMS built on UCF's canvasapi wrapper for the Canvas LMS REST API

Sorry this isn't detailed yet. I had started this version of the project about a week ago and decided this would be more useful as a web interface. However, I didn't know anything about web hosting or frameworks... it was a struggle. I learned a little bit of Django and was able to produce a couple working pages... but I really don't want this infomration being saved on a server (especially since it uses access tokens right now).

Anyway, back to the drawing board (TKinter) to make a rough UI so I am not so overwhelmed when I try to make this a web app. Hopefully when that time comes, I will have someone to mentor me through Django (and foundations of web development... of course, I could just read more! :P)
